													DMV tests all applicants to ensure they can see well enough to drive safely. If you take your vision test with corrective or contact lenses, your driver’s license will have a corrective lenses restriction. If you do not pass your vision test, you will be asked to have your
													eye doctor complete a Report of Vision Examination form.

													<strong>Behind-the-Wheel Drive Test</strong>
												</p>

												<p>
													When you apply for an original driver’s license, you will be tested on your ability to safely drive a vehicle. Upon renewal, drivers with a vision or medical condition may be required to take a behind-the-wheel test. The examiner may give two or more instructions at one
													time to determine whether you can understand and properly follow both directions. For example, “At the next street, make a left turn, and then at the first intersection make another left turn.”

									</span>
								</p>

								<p>Interpreters may be used during the pre-drive inspection for the identification and use of certain controls in the vehicle but may not accompany you during the drive test.</p>

								<p>Only the examiner is allowed to accompany you during the drive test. Exceptions are made for training, service animals, and certain law enforcement situations.</p>

								<p>The use of a recording device, including a video/audio recorder, is prohibited during a behind-the-wheel drive test. If the recording device cannot be powered off or disabled, the applicant must block it so there is no visual or audio recording during the drive test.</p>

								<h2 className="wp-block-heading">Other Things to Know for Your Behind-the-Wheel Test</h2>

								<p>
									The drive test is intended to determine your skill in operating a motor vehicle in most road situations and evaluate your abilities, not the vehicle’s technology. Therefore, advanced driver assistance systems technologies, such as automated parallel parking, lane departure, and
									adaptive cruise control, are not permitted during the drive test. Vehicle safety technology, such as backup cameras and blind spot monitors, may be used on the drive test, but are not a replacement for an actual visual check of your mirrors and blind spots.
